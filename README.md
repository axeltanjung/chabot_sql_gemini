# Chatbot SQL with Gemini

# Project: create_chatbot_sql_gemini

## Overview
The `create_chatbot_sql_gemini` project aims to develop a chatbot that interacts with a SQL database. The chatbot is designed to understand natural language queries, convert them into SQL queries, execute them against the database, and return the results to the user in a conversational format.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** The chatbot uses NLP techniques to understand and process user queries.
- **SQL Query Generation:** Converts natural language queries into SQL queries.
- **Database Interaction:** Executes SQL queries against a specified database.
- **Conversational Interface:** Returns query results in a user-friendly conversational format.

## Components
1. **NLP Module:** Handles the parsing and understanding of user input.
2. **SQL Generator:** Translates parsed user input into SQL queries.
3. **Database Connector:** Manages connections to the SQL database and executes queries.
4. **Response Formatter:** Formats the query results into a conversational response.

## Usage
1. **Initialize the Chatbot:** Set up the chatbot with the necessary configurations and database connections.
2. **User Interaction:** Users can input their queries in natural language.
3. **Query Processing:** The chatbot processes the input, generates a SQL query, executes it, and returns the results.
